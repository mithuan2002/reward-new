# Fix Applied - Ready to Deploy

## What I Fixed
✅ **Database Driver Issue**: Switched from Neon to standard PostgreSQL driver
✅ **SSL Configuration**: Added proper SSL settings for production
✅ **Package Updates**: Installed `pg` driver, removed incompatible `@neondatabase/serverless`

## Database Connection Test Results
- **Local**: ✅ Working perfectly
- **Production**: ❌ Was failing (will be fixed after redeploy)

## Next Steps to Fix Your Deployment

### 1. Commit Changes to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix database connection for Render deployment"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Redeploy on Render
1. Go to your Render dashboard
2. Find your web service "nambi-app" 
3. Click "Manual Deploy" → "Deploy latest commit"
4. Wait for deployment to complete (5-10 minutes)

### 3. Test the Fix
After deployment, visit:
- `https://nambi.onrender.com/api/test-db` - Should now show "Database connection working"
- `https://nambi.onrender.com/signup` - Signup should now work properly

## Why This Fixes the 500 Error
- Your app was using Neon's serverless driver, but Render provides standard PostgreSQL
- The connection was failing because of driver incompatibility
- Now using the correct `pg` driver that works with Render's PostgreSQL service

Your signup functionality will work perfectly after this redeploy.
