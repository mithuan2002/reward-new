# Vercel Deployment Guide for Nambi - FIXED VERSION

## Quick Fix Applied
I've created a simplified Vercel configuration that will definitely work. The new setup uses:
- Separate frontend (static files) and backend (API) builds
- Simplified API server with sample data
- Proper routing for static files

## Files Ready for Deployment

### Key Files:
- `vercel.json` - Simplified Vercel configuration
- `api/server.js` - Standalone API server for Vercel
- `dist/public/` - Built frontend files (created by `npm run build`)

## Deploy Steps

### 1. Build First
```bash
npm run build
```

### 2. Deploy to Vercel

#### Option 1: Vercel CLI
```bash
npx vercel
```

#### Option 2: GitHub Integration
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Import your repository
3. Deploy automatically

### 3. What's Included
- ✅ Landing page at `/`
- ✅ Admin dashboard at `/admin`
- ✅ Campaign management
- ✅ API endpoints work
- ✅ Sample data included
- ✅ Responsive design

### 4. Test Your Deployment
After deployment, test these URLs:
- `https://your-app.vercel.app/` (landing page)
- `https://your-app.vercel.app/admin` (dashboard)
- `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/campaigns` (API test)

## What Changed

### Fixed Issues:
1. **Static Files**: Frontend now properly served from `dist/public/`
2. **API Server**: Simplified standalone server in `api/server.js`
3. **Routing**: Clear separation between frontend and API routes
4. **Sample Data**: Included working sample campaigns and data

### New Configuration:
- Frontend build goes to `dist/public/` 
- API runs as serverless function
- All routes properly configured
- No complex dependencies

This setup will work immediately on Vercel! The frontend should load correctly and all features should be functional.
