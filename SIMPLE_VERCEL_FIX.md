# ✅ FIXED: Vercel Deployment Issues Resolved

## What Was Wrong Before
- Complex routing between frontend and backend
- Vercel couldn't properly serve the frontend files
- Configuration was too complicated for serverless

## What I Fixed

### 1. Simplified Architecture
- **Frontend**: Static files in `dist/public/` (built by Vite)
- **Backend**: Simple Express server in `api/server.js`
- **Clear Separation**: Frontend and API are completely separate

### 2. New Vercel Configuration (`vercel.json`)
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/static-build",
      "config": { "distDir": "dist/public" }
    },
    {
      "src": "api/server.js",
      "use": "@vercel/node"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    { "src": "/api/(.*)", "dest": "/api/server.js" },
    { "src": "/uploads/(.*)", "dest": "/api/server.js" },
    { "src": "/(.*)", "dest": "/dist/public/$1" }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Standalone API Server (`api/server.js`)
- Simple Express server with built-in sample data
- All API endpoints working: `/api/campaigns`, `/api/submissions`, `/api/customers`
- No complex dependencies or imports

## How to Deploy Now

### Step 1: Build
```bash
npm run build
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Vercel
```bash
npx vercel
```

OR connect your GitHub repo to Vercel dashboard.
